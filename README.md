# Coloors

The Coloors app is a color palette generator created for learning purposes. It allows you to save your colors in a library, generate random colors, and adjust color attributes such as hue and saturation. You can also name your palettes and preview them before saving. In addition, the app enables you to copy your palettes to the clipboard for easy use in other applications.
